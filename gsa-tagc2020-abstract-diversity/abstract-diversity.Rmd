We present a curriculum for a diversity-promoting professional development course 
for future college instructors. We implemented the curriculum in both in-person 
and online formats. Weekly class meetings focused on activities and discussions 
of teaching practices that encourage and support the increasingly diverse student 
body in higher education. Topics included understanding the dimensions of 
diversity, practicing strategies to combat microaggressions in real time, 
reviewing pedagological approaches to support inclusivity, and exploring data and 
research to support classroom practices. By targeting our classes at current 
graduate students who wish to become professors, we aim to effect institutional 
change over many years. We conclude the presentation with lessons learned and 
future directions.
