We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental 
populations. We demonstrate our approach in studies with Diversity 
Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice. A key element in our procedure is 
the inference of QTL allelic series in a multiparental cohort. We then 
use the allelic series in QTL detection in a distinct cohort. Specifically, 
we use the inferred number of QTL alleles (which may be less than the number 
of founders) when mapping in the second cohort. We complement our analyses with 
simluation studies in which we know the true allelic series. We 
also discuss implications for experimental design with multiparental populations.
