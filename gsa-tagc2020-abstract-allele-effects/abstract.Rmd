We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental 
populations. We leverage findings in one 
multiparental cohort to inform mapping methods in a second multiparental cohort.
We demonstrate our approach in studies with Diversity 
Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice. 
We complement our analyses with 
simluation studies to assess statistical power to detect QTL. We 
also discuss implications for experimental design with multiparental populations.
