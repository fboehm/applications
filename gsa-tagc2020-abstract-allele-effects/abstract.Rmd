We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental populations. We leverage position 
and allele effect information for individual traits in one population to increase power to detect similar 
associations in the same population or a second multiparental cohort.  We demonstrate our approach in 
studies with Diversity Outbred (DO) and Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. We complement our analyses with 
simluation studies to assess statistical power to detect QTL. We discuss applications for this approach 
in high-dimensional expression QTL studies and for joint analysis of CC and DO populations.
