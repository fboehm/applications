We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental 
populations. We demonstrate our approach in studies from Diversity 
Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice. A key element in our procedure is 
the inference of QTL allelic series in a multiparental cohort. We then 
use the allelic series in QTL detection in a distinct cohort. In our 
example, we identify QTL allelic series in a Collaborative Cross cohort, 
then use that information in QTL scans in Diversity Outbred mice.
