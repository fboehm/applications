Enhancing QTL detection power in multiparental populations
================

We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental
populations. We demonstrate our approach in studies from Diversity
Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice. A key element in our procedure is
the inference of QTL allelic series in a multiparental cohort. We then
use the allelic series in QTL scans in a distinct cohort. In our
example, we identify QTL allelic series in a Collaborative Cross cohort,
then use that information in QTL scans in Diversity Outbred mice.
