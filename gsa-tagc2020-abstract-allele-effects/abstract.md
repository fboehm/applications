Enhancing QTL detection power in multiparental populations
================

We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental
populations. We leverage position and allele effect information for
individual traits in one population to increase power to detect similar
associations in the same population or a second multiparental cohort. We
demonstrate our approach in studies with Diversity Outbred (DO) and
Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. We complement our analyses with
simluation studies to assess statistical power to detect QTL. We discuss
applications for this approach in high-dimensional expression QTL
studies and for joint analysis of CC and DO populations.
