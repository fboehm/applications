Enhancing QTL detection power in multiparental populations
================

We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental
populations. We demonstrate our approach in studies with Diversity
Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice. A key element in our procedure is
the inference of QTL allelic series in a multiparental cohort. We then
use the allelic series in QTL detection in a distinct cohort.
Specifically, we use the inferred number of QTL alleles (which may be
less than the number of founders) when mapping in the second cohort. We
complement our analyses with simluation studies in which we know the
true allelic series. We also discuss implications for experimental
design with multiparental populations.
