Enhancing QTL detection power in multiparental populations
================

We present a strategy to enhance power to detect QTL in multiparental
populations. We leverage findings in one multiparental cohort to inform
mapping methods in a second multiparental cohort. We demonstrate our
approach in studies with Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice.
We complement our analyses with simluation studies to assess statistical
power to detect QTL. We also discuss implications for experimental
design with multiparental populations.
