Leveraging genetically diverse mice to identify host genes that affect
tuberculosis susceptibility

Quantitative genetics seeks to identify genes that contribute to
phenotypic variation in populations. Recent development of multiparental
mouse populations has renewed research interest in linkage mapping
methods, such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* research community is uniquely positioned
to leverage genetic and molecular trait data from diverse mouse
populations. Multiple research teams have genotyped and phenotyped
hundreds of mice from the Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross
populations. We develop a QTL mapping framework for integrating
genotypic and phenotypic data from these two mouse populations. We draw
on genetic strengths of each population, high recombination counts and
high heterozygosity levels in Diversity Outbred mice and reproducibility
of Collaborative Cross mice, to examine the genetic underpinnings of
tuberculosis susceptibility. Statistical power to detect QTL is greater
with the combined (Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross) analysis
and, thus, our methods refine and extend previous QTL mapping studies of
tuberculosis-related traits.
