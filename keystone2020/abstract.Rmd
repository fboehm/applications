One aim of quantitative genetics is to identify genetic variants that influence 
phenotypic variations in disease-related traits. 
Recent development of multiparental mouse populations, 
which incorporate DNA from more than two founders,
has renewed research interest in quantitative
trait locus (QTL) mapping for complex phenotypes. We are 
uniquely positioned to leverage genetic and molecular trait data from diverse 
mouse populations. We have genotyped and phenotyped hundreds 
of mice from the Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross populations. We 
present a QTL mapping framework for integrating genotypic and phenotypic data 
from these two mouse populations. We draw on strengths of each 
population, high recombination counts and high heterozygosity levels in Diversity 
Outbred mice and genetic reproducibility of Collaborative Cross mice, to 
examine genetic underpinnings of tuberculosis susceptibility.
