Assessing the Evidence for a Causal Effect of Fibromuscular Dysplasia on Chronic Kidney and Biomarkers of Kidney Function: A Mendelian Randomization Study

> Abstract (max 1200 characters):

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic disease of artery walls that often affects medium-sized artery beds, including those of the renal arteries [@olin2011diagnosis;@mousa2013renal;@sang1989etiologic]. 
Multiple studies implicated renal artery FMD in impaired kidney function [@hunt1965hypertension;@oliva2018kidneys;@mounier2002parenchymal;@van2018renal]. We sought to quantify 
causal effects of FMD on chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a two-sample Mendelian randomization study with GWAS summary statistics. 
We used genetic instruments for FMD from a meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies of multifocal FMD [@georges2021genetic]. 
For each putative outcome variable, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis with inverse-variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, weighted mode, and simple mode methods. We obtained association effect estimates for putative outcomes from publicly available summary statistics from UK Biobank GWAS [@neale_lab_gwas].
We considered three different p-value thresholds when choosing relevant SNP instruments for MR analyses. All five methods showed no evidence of a causal effect of FMD on CKD. To further evaluate our findings, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess evidence of horizontal pleiotropy and other sources of confounding [@skrivankova2021strengthening;@burgess2017sensitivity].
