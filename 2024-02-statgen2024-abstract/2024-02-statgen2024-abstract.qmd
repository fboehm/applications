Assessing the Evidence for a Causal Effect of Fibromuscular Dysplasia on Chronic Kidney and Biomarkers of Kidney Function: A Mendelian Randomization Study

> Abstract (max 1200 characters):

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic disease of artery walls that often affects medium-sized artery beds, including those of the renal arteries [@olin2011diagnosis;@mousa2013renal;@sang1989etiologic]. 
Multiple studies and case reports have implicated renal artery FMD in impaired kidney function [@hunt1965hypertension;@oliva2018kidneys;@mounier2002parenchymal;@van2018renal]. We sought to quantify 
the causal effects of: FMD on chronic kidney disease, FMD on plasma Cystatin C level, and FMD on plasma creatinine level. 
We used used publicly available summary statistics in a two-sample Mendelian randomization study. 
Specifically, we used genetic instruments for FMD from a meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies of multifocal FMD [@georges2021genetic]. 
For each of the three putative outcome variables (chronic kidney disease, plasma Cystatin C level, and plasma creatinine level), we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis with inverse-variance weighted, weighted median, and MR-Egger methods. We obtained association estimates for putative outcomes from publicly available summary statistics from UK Biobank GWAS [@neale_lab_gwas].
