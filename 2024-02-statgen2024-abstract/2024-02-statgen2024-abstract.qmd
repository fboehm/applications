No Evidence for a Causal Effect of Fibromuscular Dysplasia on Chronic Kidney and Biomarkers of Kidney Function: A Mendelian Randomization Study

> Abstract (max 1200 characters):

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic disease of artery walls that often affects medium-sized artery beds, including those of the renal arteries [@olin2011diagnosis;@mousa2013renal;@sang1989etiologic]. 
Multiple studies and case reports have implicated renal artery FMD in impaired kidney function [@hunt1965hypertension;@oliva2018kidneys;@mounier2002parenchymal;@van2018renal]. We sought to quantify 
the causal effects of: FMD on chronic kidney disease, FMD on plasma Cystatin C level, and FMD on plasma creatinine level. With the growing availability of genome-wide association study results, we used 
used publicly available summary statistics in a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
