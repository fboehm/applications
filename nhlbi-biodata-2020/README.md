    Letters of support - Two letters of support from mentors or key collaborators are are required. Letters for projects arising from TOPMed Working Groups should demonstrate the applicantâ€™s critical participation in a relevant working group and confirm that the applicant has (or will have) access to the appropriate data and that the proposed project is supported by the Working Group.  Letters of support should include contact information (full name, position title, organization, email/phone number) of the reference. 
    Biographical sketch - A biographical sketch or (NIH) biosketch (not to exceed 5 pages) is required.
    Abstract - Provide an abstract on your research question and how your proposed project will address the goals of the Fellows Program. (175 words maximum)
    Project aims - Describe concisely the specific research approach you intend to take, specifically outlining aims, goals, deliverables, and timelines for the year. (675 words maximum)
    Prior studies - Using examples of work, by you or others, please outline how your proposed project would align with past studies. Please provide sufficient background to demonstrate project feasibility, and that your project can be completed successfully in the duration of the year. (250 words maximum)
    Expertise - Describe your familiarity with genomic analysis, statistical programming, and cloud based computation.
    Methods and materials - Explain what methods and material are to be used in the project such as protocols, data, software, analysis; and how you plan to use the BioData Catalyst ecosystem to enhance your proposed project. Provide details on the status of your access to the relevant datasets (e.g. IRB approval, data use agreements), whether you are currently engaged with working groups (e.g. TOPMED), and/or outline plans to obtain data access during the Fellows Program. Include an estimate of the scale of the proposed analyses (e.g., the sample size, number of proposed analyses, and types data expected to be used). (450 words maximum)
    Engagement - Indicate how you will engage and collaborate with Consortium members, Fellows peer group, and the broader community. (175 words maximum)
    Budget estimate - Provide a budget estimate including expected research costs and costs for travel, training, publication, and conference fees. (100 words maximum)
    References - Provide a list of references cited in the previous questions here (225 words maximum)

    The proposal is relevant to the research topic and speaks to novel approaches to challenges in the research area.
    The proposal addresses an important scientific question that can be usefully answered using the BioData Catalyst ecosystem along with the available data resources and in the 1-year timeframe.
    The applicant has obtained IRB approval, data use agreements (e.g. dbGaP), is participating in working groups (e.g. TOPMED), and/or is in the process of obtaining data access and dbGaP data use agreements before applying.
    The applicant has demonstrated the necessary background and capabilities to accomplish the proposed work.
