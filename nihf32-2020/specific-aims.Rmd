# SPECIFIC AIMS

Multiparental mouse populations have revolutionized systems genetics by incorporating
diverse collections of genetic variants into mapping cohorts, enabling deep phenotyping, and enhancing 
mapping resolution and biological reproducibility. 
In particular, these populations are being used to extensively model and understand infectious diseases. 
While a 
great deal of data are available from a variety of model infections, analytic methods that enhance statistical 
power to detect genetic loci (quantitative trait loci, QTL) that affect these infection-related traits are still lacking.

Two complementary mapping populations, the
Collaborative Cross and the Diversity Outbred mice, arise from the same eight inbred 
founder lines, and, therefore, they share the same collection of genetic variants. However, the two mapping cohorts 
differ in their genetic architecture and possess complementary strengths. The Collaborative Cross is a collection of 
recombinant inbred lines that allow experimental replication and serial phenotyping of 
genetically identical subjects, while the 
Diversity Outbred is a collection of highly heterozygous and genetically unique 
mice with small recombination intervals.

Both Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred populations have been used to model tuberculosis pathogenesis. 
Our colleagues in the Sassetti laboratory have performed deep 
phenotyping of Collaborative Cross mice after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and our collaborators have quantified 
the susceptibility of a large panel of Diversity Outbred animals. In both cases, Mtb infection produces a wide range of
outcomes, which in some cases can be associated with QTL.  However, the lack of concordance between these studies 
suggests that many more associations might be observed with more sensitive QTL detection methods.

We propose an analytic framework that leverages the strengths of both Collaborative Cross and 
Diversity Outbred mice. We first develop a strategy to infer allelic series at QTL in one population. 
Then, because the other population shares the same alleles, we are able to probe the second 
population with enhanced statistical power.  This strategy will increase the resolution of mapping in 
the Collaborative Cross panel, 
and allow susceptibility traits from the Diversity Outbred to be associated with more specific 
phenoytpes in the Collaborative Cross.  



**Specific Aim 1.** *METHODS: Design and implement new biostatistical methods for parametric bayesian inference of allelic series at established QTL in multiparental populations.* 

We propose a novel Bayesian statistical framework for inferring allelic series at QTL. Knowing the 
allelic series, 
*i.e.*, allelic number and configuration, enables QTL mapping with fewer statistical parameters, and, 
thus, enhanced 
statistical power (when the allelic series is accurately inferred).


**Specific Aim 2.** *APPLICATION: Apply allelic series inferences to complex traits from Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice.* 

We will apply our 
methods to tuberculosis-related traits in Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross 
mice. Specifically, we will leverage initial results in Diversity Outbred mice to inform mapping in Collaborative 
Cross mice.

**Specific Aim 3.** *SOFTWARE: Create and share an open-source software package that implements our methods.* 

We will create a user-friendly, open-source R software package and share it via Github. 
To encourage durability of our software and methods, we'll use Docker and Dockerhub
to execute and share our analyses and tests.
