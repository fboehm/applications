**Specific Aim 1.** 
Design and implement new biostatistical methods for parametric bayesian 
inference of allelic series at established QTL in multiparental 
populations. 

A lynchpin in this aim is development of a Markov chain monte carlo sampler for inferring allelic series at known QTL with parametric bayes methods. MCMC methods are notoriously computationally intensive and may demonstrate poor mixing, especially in the case of reversible jump MCMC. To circumvent known issues with trans-dimensional reversible jump MCMC methods, we propose to translate methods of Yi et al to our setting. [Explain Yi's models]

Note that we know the true upper limit for the number of alleles, since it is merely the number of founder lines.
