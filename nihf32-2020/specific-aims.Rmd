# SPECIFIC AIMS

Multiparental mouse populations have revolutionized systems genetics by incorporating
diverse collections of genetic variants, enabling deep phenotyping, and enhancing 
mapping resolution and biological reproducibility. 
In particular, these populations are being used to extensively model and understand infectious diseases. 
While much data is available from a variety of model infections, powerful analytic methods to detect genetic loci (quantitative trait loci, QTL) that affect infection-related traits are still lacking.

Two complementary mapping populations, the
Collaborative Cross and the Diversity Outbred mice, arise from the same eight inbred 
founder lines and, therefore, share the same collection of genetic variants. However, the two mapping cohorts 
differ in their genetic architecture and possess complementary strengths. 
The Collaborative Cross is a collection of 
recombinant inbred lines that allow experimental replication and serial phenotyping of 
genetically identical subjects, while the 
Diversity Outbred is a collection of highly heterozygous and genetically unique 
mice with small recombination intervals.

Both Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred populations have been used to model tuberculosis pathogenesis. 
Our colleagues have performed deep 
phenotyping of Collaborative Cross mice after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and our collaborators have quantified Mtb 
susceptibility in a large panel of Diversity Outbred animals. In both cases, Mtb infection produces a wide range of 
outcomes, some of which can be associated with QTL.  However, the lack of concordance between these studies 
suggests that many more QTL might be observed with more sensitive QTL detection methods.

We propose an analytic framework that leverages strengths of both Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice. 
By first developing a strategy to infer allelic series at a QTL in Diversity Outbred mice, we then are able to probe the Collaborative Cross with enhanced statistical power. This strategy will increase mapping resolution in the Collaborative Cross mice
and allow susceptibility-related traits from the Diversity Outbred to be associated with more specific phenotypes in the Collaborative Cross. 


**Specific Aim 1.** *METHODS: Design and implement new biostatistical methods for parametric bayesian inference of allelic series at established QTL in multiparental populations.* 

We propose a novel Bayesian statistical framework for inferring allelic series at QTL. Knowing the 
allelic series, 
*i.e.*, allelic number and configuration, enables QTL mapping with fewer statistical parameters, and, 
thus, enhanced 
statistical power (when the allelic series is accurately inferred).


**Specific Aim 2.** *APPLICATION: Apply allelic series inferences to complex traits from Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross mice.* 

We will apply our 
methods to tuberculosis-related traits in Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross 
mice. Specifically, we will leverage initial results in Diversity Outbred mice to inform mapping in Collaborative 
Cross mice.

**Specific Aim 3.** *SOFTWARE: Create and share an open-source software package that implements our methods.* 

We will create and share a user-friendly, open-source R software package and a website that documents our software.
