# RESEARCH STRATEGY

**I. SIGNIFICANCE** Multiparental populations of model organisms incorporate DNA from more than two founders and offer unique opportunities to dissect genetics of complex traits. Two widely used mouse populations are the Diversity Outbred and the Collaborative Cross. Both arise from the same eight founders. The Diversity Outbred is a heterogeneous stock with genomes that are highly heterozygous mosaics of the eight founder genomes. The Collaborative Cross, on the other hand, is a collection of inbred lines derived from the eight founder genomes. As such, the Collaborative Cross offers the ability to replicate a study on mice with identical (or nearly identical) genomes. Each Diversity Outbred mouse, alternatively, is genetically unique. Strengths of the Diversity Outbred include the wide range of allelic combinations, for a collection of loci, in a single cohort. 
Applied bayesian statistics offers a rich suite of methods for learning from data. Central to any bayesian analysis is specification of prior distributions for unobserved quantities. 

In traditional two-parent crosses, a QTL is a genomic region where the two founder alleles have distinct effects on the trait. Because only two founders are used in such crosses, there was never a need to consider whether multiple founders shared an allele. While studies with the Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross have yielded many new biological insights, concerns remain about statistical power to detect QTL in such studies. Our proposal aims to impact this aspect of
