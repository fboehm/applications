**1. Developing multivariate QTL mapping methods for systems genetics studies**

In my Ph.D. thesis research, I developed methods for testing the presence of a single pleiotropic QTL against separate QTL in multiparental populations. In many systems genetics studies, investigators use univariate mapping to identify QTL that affect a single trait. @jiang1995multiple observed that multivariate QTL mapping methods enable researchers to not only identify QTL that affect a collection of traits, but also permit the researcher to ask questions about whether a single locus affects multiple traits. 

My pleiotropy vs. separate QTL test hinges on a multivariate, multi-QTL scan that incorporates multivariate random effects to account for relatedness. Multivariate random effects are notoriously difficult and computationally costly to fit. I adapted an existing method to multiparental populations. 

I characterized the methods with simulated traits before applying it to two behavioral traits that map to a single genomic region. I simultaneously implemented the methods in an open-source, user-friendly software package for the R statistical computing environment. I also applied the methods to a pair of microbiome-derived traits. I subsequently studied the test performance in expression trait hotspot dissection (unpublished results).
