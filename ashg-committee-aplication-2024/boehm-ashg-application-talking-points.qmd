## Reference form questions

**Please describe the applicant's leadership skills, including his/her previous professional and/or volunteer experience**

Fred served as a member of the Early Career Scientist Community and Membership Engagement (CME) Subcommittee for the Genetics Society of America from February 2020 to January 2022. As a member of the CME subcommittee, Fred participated in monthly video meetings, organized, facilitated, advertised, and moderated monthly online research seminars that featured early career geneticists, and completed a 6-week online training program in Leadership and Management in Action Program with a cohort of about fifteen early career geneticists (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xp9-gjLDxlrPtHyF4FqTf9_q0-aL47av/view).  

Fred was a reliable and active participant in the CME subcommittee. Despite complications arising from the global covid19 pandemic, he never missed a monthly online meeting in his two years of membership. He met all deadlines for organizing and facilitating the monthly online research seminars, and he was an effective and supportive moderator during the seminars. He communicated effectively while recruiting and coordinating with seminar speakers, and he was a positive and supportive presence in the subcommittee.

His other leadership accomplishments outside GSA, including his roles as Mathcounts coach for middle school students (both in Massachusetts and Wisconsin), founder of a learning center for homeless children, and his ongoing work as a penpal with an economically disadvantaged pre-scientist in Redwood City, demonstrate his commitment to leadership and service in the scientific community.  




**How will the applicant's interests and experience benefit the Board?**

Fred's enthusiasm for his service work, when coupled with his professional dedication to science and development of inclusive and equitable scientific communities, will make him an excellent addition to the ASHG Program Committee. His ability to meet task deadlines and eagerness to connect scientists and future scientists will be a real asset for the ASHG Board. His experience as a member of the GSA CME subcommittee, where he organized and facilitated monthly online research seminars, will be particularly beneficial for the Program Committee. His experience in organizing and facilitating these seminars will be directly applicable to the responsibilities of the Program Committee, which include reviewing and programming abstracts, reviewing featured symposium proposals, and planning other special sessions for the Annual Meeting. His experience in these areas will allow him to contribute to the scientific content of the Annual Meeting in a meaningful way.  





**Other comments**

Fred is perpetually curious as a scientist and as a person. He is always eager to learn and to share his knowledge with others. He is a dedicated and reliable team member, and he is always willing to go the extra mile to help others. He actively undertakes professional development activities to ensure that he is always honing existing skills and developing new skills. I am confident that he will be an excellent addition to the ASHG Program Committee.
