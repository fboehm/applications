About the You3 Program
You3  – A Leadership and Management Program for Postdocs is a structured program aimed at filling a critical need in postdoc professional development for current training and future career success. This program was designed by postdocs for postdocs under the guidance of OGPS Leadership. Based on postdoc survey data and pedagogical best practices, this program is structured as eight 1.5-hour weekly modules to develop mastery in three aspects of management and leadership - Yourself, Your Team, and Your Project. The program modules will be facilitated by the OGPS Professional Development team along with U-M campus experts in select module topics. The program will be enriched with effective tools and case-studies to provide learning opportunities for participants while developing a postdoc community through the cohort model.
